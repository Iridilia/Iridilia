### 👾 hello world 
Hello ! My name is Sarah and I am 20 year-old french student at IUT Nancy-Charlemagne in France. I'm currently in my third year of a bachelor in Web Development but my ultimate goal would be to become a full-stack developer.

Passionate about technology and computing, I am a self-taught woman with great curiosity, I like to launch innovative projects and discover new techniques. I am open to the unknown and I like to learn in the field. Creative, I also really enjoy adding my personal touch and reflecting on new solutions.
